h1. Hand signals

Hand signals are an essential part of our "communication":communication.html and "decision-making":decisions.html system.

Think about it. If 25 people are sitting in a big circle, and one person wants to find out how they feel about a decision, what's fastest? Asking everyone to speak up? Asking everyone to write on stickynotes or fill in a survey? Those ways are fine if you want details. But if you just want a quick temperature check, or test for agreement, then hand signals are superior - because it takes just 10 seconds for everyone to hold up a hand signal and see what everyone else thinks.
