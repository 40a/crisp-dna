# What is Crisp and why?

Our purpose is summarized in this A3.

It hangs on the wall in our office, and we bring it to our conferences so it can be easily updated (it's written in pencil...). Here's what is says:

**Crisp is a home for IT consultants who value:**
    
* **Community** - We want to hang out with other people who share our values
* **Freedom** - We want to control our own time
* **Competence** - We want to continuously learn
* **Good citizenship** - Heart over wallet
* **Professionalism** - We genuinely care about solving our customers' problems
    
We believe these values lead to personal happiness as well as business success.

Basically, we are trying to find the sweet spot between being an independent consultant (full freedom, no support), and being an employee (little freedom, lots of support).
