h1. How Crisp works

Our second A3 is called "Crisp strategy" but it's really more about how we operate:

It hangs on the wall next to the "What is Crisp":what-is-crisp.html A3. Here's an "english translation":../assets/CrispStrategyA3-en.pdf of the pic. Summarized below:

h1. What do we measure?

We measure:

* How happy we are (see "Happiness Index":happiness-index.html)
* How happy our customers are. (actually, this point is partly aspirational. Currently our only systematic customer satisfaction metric is Net Promoter Score for course participants).

h1. How do we finance the home?

To cover our costs, every Crisper pays a fixed fee per month + % fee of their revenue. The fixed fee is usually around SEK 3000-5000, and the variable fee is usually around 7-15%. The fee is intended only to cover Crisp's costs, so we adjust it every quarter based on how much money we have in our coffers. If we have less than our desired liquidity buffer then we raise the fees, and vice versa. 

bq. *Why a fixed + variable fee?* If we only had a fixed fee, consultants on the bench would quickly run out of money. And if we had only a variable fee, we might have trouble covering our fixed costs if many consultants are on the bench. With a fixed + variable fee, we get a nice balance that matches the fact that our costs are also fixed + variable. It is also typical Sweeedish to pick a model that is "lagom":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom - noone is really happy with the end result ;-).

h1. What do we do with the money?

This picture sums it up:

The guiding principles are:

* *Naked in, Naked out* - you don't need to cash out to join Crisp, and there's nothing to cash out when you leave.  
* *No gold on the table* - we don't try to build financial value in the company.
* *No pot of gold at that end* - there's no financial incentive to sell the company.
* *A gold-strewn road* - you keep most of what you earn, as you earn it.

bq. **Why don't we try to build financial value?** If Crisp has a big pile of money, that creates a financial incentive to own the company, and increases the risk of conflict as the "value" of the company goes up and down. If we keep the company lean, with only a small liquidity buffer, then we don't need to argue about who owns what.
