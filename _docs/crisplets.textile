h1. Crisplets

How do bottom-up initiatives get funded? How do you get money to do something without a budget process?

h2. What is a Crisplet?

A Crisplet is a loosely coupled interest group of Crispers who want to fund an initiative.

Within a Crisplet we work on things where there is no common interest from all of Crisp, but a bunch of Crispers want to do something together.

If the initiative is in the interest of all Crispers, then it is reasonable that it can be handled through the Office staff, Board or Sales. 

h2. What is required of a Crisplet

* A wiki page describing the purpose of the Crisplet, how collaboration is done and who has joined
* A link from the list of Crisplets to the wiki page describing the Crisplet
* All Crisplets are open to all Crispers
* Every new Crisplet is announced over e-mail with a "OBS: " subject prefix. See: "E-mail conventions".

* Economics - you can get help with financial administration, see Crisplet Accounts below.
