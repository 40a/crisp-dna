Crisp Hack Summit is a event where we meet up at a off-site location and hack on pet projects and similar.

Part of our idea to always keep learning new things, and to dedicate 20% of our time to personal development. The Hack Summit concept is part of this.


## Why is it called Crisp Hack Summit?

We like the combination of the slightly unserious "Hack" and the quite pretentious "Summit".
