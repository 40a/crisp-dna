h1. Visions

One big aha in our evolution was when we realized that Crisp itself is just a platform. 

Crisp itself doesn't have a Vision (with a Big V), other than to be a "nice home for consultants":what-is-crisp.html.

However, many of the _people_ at Crisp do have a vision. Here are ones that most people agree with, and nobody disagrees with:

*Vision 1:*
* Swedish original: "Hjälpa företag att få nytta av Lean/Agile"
* English translation: "Help companies benefit from Lean/Agile"

*Vision 2:*
* Swedish original: "Utveckla företag och organisationer så att människor där trivs, utvecklas, och skapar ökande värde "
* English translation: "Develop companies and organizations so the people there can be happy, can develop themselves, and create increasing value."

h2. How we work with visions

We're guided by this principles (which we agreed upon on one of our unconferences):

* Crisp can have several visions
* They can and should only be changed at our unconferences, so everyone can discuss
* The visions apply between the unconferences
* If you miss an unconference, you are automatically considered to "stand aside" (see our "hand signals":hand-signals.html)
*
