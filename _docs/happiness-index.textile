h1. Crisp Happiness Index

Our primary metric is “Nöjd Crispare Index” (in english: “Happy Crisper Index” or “Crisp happiness index”). Scale is 1-5. We measure this continuously through a live Google Spreadsheet. Some people update it once a month, others much less frequently, a select few hardly ever do it, to the frustration of some.

It typically looks like this

h2. Column details

The Average column is automatically calculated as the average of the next three columns:

* At Crisp - How do I generally feel about being at Crisp, are you happy?
* Work at Crisp - How do I feel about your work within Crisp, as a staff hired by Crisp, or as a consultant doing something for Crisp
* Work as a consultant - How do I feel about my work as a consultant

Everyone fills in how they feel at Crisp, the first column, some fill in the second, some the third.

We chart the history and how it correlates to specific events and bring this data to our conference.

Happiness index history

Whenever the average changes significantly we talk about why, and what we can do to make everybody happier. If we see a 1 or 2 on any row, that acts as an effective call for help. People go out of their way to find out how they can help that person, which often results in some kind of process improvement in the company. This happened last week, one person dropped to a 1 due to confusion and frustration with our internal invoicing routines. Within a week we did a workshop and figured out a better process. The company improved and the Crisp Happiness Index increased.

Crisp Happiness Index is more important than any financial metric, not only because it visualizes the aspect that matters most to us, but also because it is a leading indicator, which makes us agile. Most financial metrics are trailing indicators, making it hard to react to change in time.
