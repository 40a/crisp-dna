How we recruit new consultants
===
Crisp doesn't actively recruit consultants. There isn't really an economic incentive, and each new addition makes Crisp a bit more anonymous, a bit less personal.

## So, how did you get to be more than 30 consultants?

Like vampires, fresh blood makes us stronger. We like people who challenge us with new ideas, so we are happy that 2-3 new consultants joins us each year. Very few people have ever left Crisp (we are not just like vampires, we're mafia vampires), so we grow with about 2-3 consultants each year.

The only way in is by having worked with someone who is already at Crisp. This is not just to make sure the person is top notch as a consultant, we also want to know they're someone we'd like to work with for many years, even decades.

## But there's danger here

One golden rule as a consultant is to never ever hire a co-worker where you do your consulting. IT-managers don't want consultants to recruit his or her employees, so we often wait a few years down the line, when none of us are at the place where we met and worked together.

## So, who are typically joining Crisp?

Since we don't have any safety-net, base salary or such, the people who join us are

* **Comfortable with their skills**
* **A bit adventurous**, a few months without an assignment doesn't make us nervous
* **Social**, like to maintain contacts, negotiating salaries
* **Curious** enough to learn new things, every day
* **Generous** enough to share knowledge with people inside and outside of Crisp
