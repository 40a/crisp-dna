# How Crisp works

Our second A3 is called "Crisp strategy" but it's really more about how we operate:

It hangs on the wall next to the other one. Here's an [english translation](../assets/CrispStrategyA3-en.pdf) of the pic. Summarized below:

## What do we measure?

We measure:

* How happy we are (see [Happiness Index](happiness-index.html))
* How happy our customers are. (actually, this point is partly aspirational. Currently our only systemtic customer satisfaction metric is Net Promoter Score for course participants).

## How do we finance the home?

Every Crisper pays a fixed fee per month + % fee of their revenue. The fixed fee is usually around SEK 5000-10000, and the variable fee is usually around 5-12% (TODO: check these numbers). The fee is adjusted every year, based on how much money the company has. If Crisp has significantly less money than it's desired liquidity buffer, the fee is raised, and vice versa.
