# How Crisp works

Our second A3 is called "Crisp strategy" but it's really more about how we operate:

It hangs on the wall next to the other one. Here's an [english translation](../assets/CrispStrategyA3-en.pdf) of the pic. Summarized below:

## What do we measure?

We measure:

* How happy we are (see [Happiness Index](happiness-index.html))
* How happy our customers are. (actually, this point is partly aspirational. Currently our only systemtic customer satisfaction metric is Net Promoter Score for course participants).

## How do we finance the home?

To cover our costs, every Crisper pays a fixed fee per month + % fee of their revenue. The fixed fee is usually around SEK 3000-8000, and the variable fee is usually around 7-12%. The fee is intended only to cover Crisp's costs, so it is adjusted every year based on how much money we have. If we have less than our desired liquidity buffer then we raise the fees, and vice versa. 

**Why a fixed + variable fee?** If we only had a fixed fee, consultants on the bench would quickly run out of money. And if we had only a variable fee, we might have trouble covering our fixed costs if many consultants are on the bench. With a fixed + variable fee, we get a nice balance that matches the fact that our costs are also fixed + variable.
