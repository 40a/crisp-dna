## What do we measure?

We measure:

* How happy we are (see [Happiness Index](happiness-index.html))
* How happy our customers are. (actually, this point is partly aspirational. Currently our only systemtic customer satisfaction metric is Net Promoter Score for course participants).

## How do we finance the home?

The fee is intended only to cover Crisp's costs, so it is adjusted every year based on how much money we have.
