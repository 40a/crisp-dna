# Ownership model
Crisp is a swedish "aktiebolag" (comparable to a limited company). That means there are shares that someone needs to own.

"every Crisper that is still a Crisper after 2 years is offered to become a owner"

Since we strive to be a flat company, we want all the Crispers to share the burden to own the shares. On the other hand, we don't dare to let brand new Crispers to become owners right away. To balance that, every Crisper that is still a Crisper after 2 years is offered to become a owner (partner).

If, after two years, we do not trust a Crisper to become a partner, we do not trust them to stay in Crisp at all. If this happens, the person will be asked to leave Crisp.

Since we strive to keep the financial value of Crisp as low as possible, new owners can buy their shares to a reasonably low cost. When you are offered to become an owner, you can ofcourse decline. If you do, you will be offered again, every year.
