h1. Brand building

OK, none of us are experts at brand building. But we've nevertheless ended up with a strong brand within "our business":our-business.html, so here are some thoughts on how that happened.

As a consulting company, building a strong brand requires two things:
# Delight your clients
# Be visible

Both are needed. If we *only* delight our clients, but aren't visible to the world, then the brand won't get strong (except to those few that already know about us). If we are highly visible but _not_ delighting our clients, then the brand won't get strong either. Well, OK, there are companies that can pull of that trick, but it's not our style...

h2. How we delight our clients

We kind of cheat here, because our model only attracts the type of consultants that were already pretty good at delightning their clients - with or without Crisp. In fact, that's a requirement (see "recruiting":recruiting.html)! We don't have an army of sales people chasing down clients for you, and you don't get any kind of base salary if you don't have a client, so it really is in your own interest to delight your clients!

Also, our model attracts the kind of people that like to learn things and spread knowledge. And clients appreciate that.

h2. How we make ourselves visible

Visibility happens as a result of two things:

# Provide plenty of ways for Crispers to communicate with the world (web site, blog, course venue, etc)
# Get out of their way so they can shine

Again, because our model attracts the kind of people that like to learn and spread knowledge, all we have to do is make sure nothing gets in the way. That way, a bunch of cool stuff happens automatically, such as:

* "Blog articles":http://blog.crisp.se/
* "Books":https://www.crisp.se/bocker-och-produkter
* "Public courses":https://www.crisp.se/kurser and evening seminars
* "Talks and keynotes":http://blog.crisp.se/tag/slides at public conferences
* Partnerships with well-known people like "Jeff Sutherland":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Sutherland, "Mary Poppendieck":http://www.poppendieck.com/people.htm, "Jeff Patton":http://www.agileproductdesign.com, and many more.
* Physical products such as "Planning Poker":https://www.crisp.se/bocker-och-produkter/planning-poker and "Jimmy Cards":https://www.crisp.se/bocker-och-produkter/jimmy-cards

So the Crisp brand is a whole that is greater than the sum of it's parts - a bunch of creative individuals sharing stuff with the world, and indirectly building up their personal brands. 

Definitely a win-win-win situation! Win for the individual, Win for Crisp, and Win for the world (because of all the free stuff :o)
