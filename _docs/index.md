#What is this?

This site is an [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) product describing how Crisp works and why. 

[Crisp](http://www.crisp.se) is a consulting company based in Stockholm. But we aren't a very typical consulting company. 
For example:

* None of the consultants are actually employed by Crisp.
* We have no managers, instead we rely on self-organization and transparancy. Almost everything is bottom-up.
* Crisp's main purpose is to enable consultants to be happy, and Crisp Happiness Index is our driving metric. Everything else is secondary.
* Crisp doesn't want to earn money from it's consultants. It is in practice a non-profit company (although not formally so). Consultants keep most of what they earn.
* Our partnership contract is designed to make our stock financially worthless. There is no "cashing out" incentive.
* Consultants are 100% autonomous. They can do whatever they want, and work as much or as little as they want.

We get a lot of questions about how this works in practice, especially from other consultants looking to create something similar. After many years of experimenting we've converged on a model that works well, basically the sweet spot between being an independent consultant and being an employee. So we decided to [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) it.


##Why open-source the Crisp model?

* Open-sourcing it is a fun social experiment, we're curious about what's going to happen :o)
* By making our model public, we're more likely to keep it up-to-date and improve it as we learn.
* The model has helped us be happy and make a positive impact in the world, and publishing it may help others do the same.
* Putting it on GitHub makes it easier for others to clone it, and for us to follow up on how the model evolves and spreads.
