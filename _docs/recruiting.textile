h1. How we recruit new consultants

Crisp doesn't actively recruit consultants. There isn't really an economic incentive, and each new addition makes Crisp a bit more anonymous, a bit less personal.

h2. So, how did you get to be more than 30 consultants?

Like vampires, fresh blood makes us stronger. We like people who challenge us with new ideas, so we are happy that 2-3 new consultants joins us each year. Very few people have ever left Crisp (we are not just like vampires, we're mafia vampires), so we grow with about 2-3 consultants each year.

The only way in is by having worked with someone who is already at Crisp. This is not just to make sure the person is top notch as a consultant, we also want to know they're someone we'd like to work with for many years, even decades.

h2. But there's danger here

One golden rule as a consultant is to never ever hire a co-worker where you do your consulting. IT-managers don't want consultants to recruit his or her employees, so we often wait until none of us are at the place where we met and worked together.

h2. Who are typically joining Crisp?

Since we don't have any safety-net, base salary or such, consultants at Crisp are

* **Comfortable about our skills**, we know we're in high demand
* **Adventurous**, a few months without an assignment don't make us nervous
* **Social**, like to maintain contacts, passion for working out agreements
* **Curious**, learn new things, every day
* **Generous**, sharing knowledge is what we do, not for potential profit but because it is fun, and rewarding in itself

This considerably limits the number of applicants.

h2. So, you want to join Crisp?

* Make sure you have worked with someone at Crisp at a previous job
* Make sure you understand the economical implications, there is no safety-net

Now is the time to show your skills, technical and social! Present something new and exciting at an internal education evening, or join us for a "hack summit":hack-summit.html. Prepare for lots of intense discussions, critique and laughter - we're a merry bunch, but as you understand, we want to be convinced you are good at what you do. Why? Because we want to know you will do a solid job as a Crisp consultant. We've spent more than a decade building up our reputation, and we want you to make it even better!

After everyone who so wishes has had a chance to meet and talk to you, we have a deadline for vetoing your application. We're not really fond of vetoes, but for recruiting we actually traditionally have had a way for any current member to throw in a veto, blocking someone. But, the veto has never been used!

h2. What if we like you?

Welcome! You'll have to sign our "team contract":team-contract-en.html, and you must also have a corporation who will be your formal employer. We will also go for dinner at a nice restaurant, setup your email account and all that jazz, like most other companies.
