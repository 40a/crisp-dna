h1. Recruitment - how we grow

h2. We are in no hurry to grow

We don't actively recruit consultants. There's no economic incentive to do so, and each new addition makes Crisp a bit more anonymous, a bit less personal, and a bit harder to coordinate.

h2. So... how did we get to be more than 30 consultants then?

Like vampires, fresh blood makes us stronger. New people who are smart and passionate will challenge the status quo and inject new ideas! That compensates for the pain of growing. 

The right balance seems to be about 1-3 new consultants per year, so that's what we aim for. Enough to keep us on our toes without excessive growth pain. Very few people have ever left Crisp (we're not just like vampires, we're mafia vampires), so our rate of growth has been pretty linear.

OK, maybe vampire isn't the best metaphor. But you get the idea :o)

h2. Hire awesome people, or don't hire at all

Worth repeating: *hire awesome people, or don't hire at all!*
That's what "makes our model work":why-this-works.html. 

h2. Who gets to join

The only way in (with very few exceptions) is by having worked with someone who is already at Crisp. This is not just to make sure the person is top notch as a consultant, we also want to know they're someone we'd like to work with for many years, even decades.

h2. But there's danger here

One golden rule as a consultant is to never ever hire a co-worker where you do your consulting. IT-managers don't want consultants to recruit their employees, so we often wait until none of us are at the place where we met and worked together.

h2. What kind of people fit in at Crisp?

Since we don't have any economic safety net (like base salary), people that end up at Crisp are usually:

* **Comfortable about own skills**, we know we're in high demand.
* **Adventurous**, a few months without an assignment don't make us nervous.
* **Social**, like to maintain a strong network and collaborate with people.
* **Curious**, learn new things, every day. Love geeking out on new technologies, processes, etc.
* **Generous**, sharing knowledge is what we do, not for potential profit but because it is fun, and rewarding in itself.

This considerably limits the number of applicants.

h2. So, you want to join Crisp?

* Make sure you have worked with someone at Crisp at a previous job
* Make sure you understand the economical implications, there is no safety net

Now is the time to show your skills, technical and social! Present something new and exciting at an internal education evening, or join us for a "hack summit":hack-summit.html. Prepare for lots of intense discussions, critique and laughter - we're a merry bunch, but as you understand, we want to be convinced you are good at what you do. Why? Because we want to know you will do a solid job as a Crisp consultant. We've spent more than a decade building up our reputation, and we want you to make it even better!

After everyone who so wishes has had a chance to meet and talk to you, we have a deadline for vetoing your application. We're not really fond of vetoes, but for recruiting we actually traditionally have had a way for any current member to throw in a veto, blocking someone. But, the veto has never been used!

h2. What if we like you?

Welcome! You'll have to sign our "team contract":team-contract-en.html, and you must also have a corporation who will be your formal employer. We will also go for dinner at a nice restaurant, setup your email account and all that jazz, like most other companies.
